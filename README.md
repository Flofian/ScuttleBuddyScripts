# ScuttleBuddyScripts
This Repo will feature some user made scripts for ScuttleBuddy https://github.com/Business99/ScuttleBuddy-External
I havent done anything with Github before, you can always send me your scripts via Discord, either send me a friend request (Flofian#2260) or be member of the official ScuttleBuddy Discord.

Short Summary:

Minions.py shows a simple green dot on top of a minion which you can lasthit based solely on your ad\
TODO: Add a better dmg calculation, including onhit

SpellTracker.py shows a green dot for a spell thats ready, yellow for ready in under a second, and red if longer or not skilled yet\
TODO: Add the cooldown as text, maybe change how many degrees of the circle are filled based on the cooldown, but this needs a cooldown calculation with cdr and base cooldown from datadragon
